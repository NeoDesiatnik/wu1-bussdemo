        <p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone
            into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the brotha talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he
            better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'? </p>

        <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular
            gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with
            it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit. </p>

        <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the
            world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't
            know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five
            made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the
            other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

        <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
            men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of
            darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon
            thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And
            you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>
